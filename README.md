Sometimes somewhere we have to perform encryption and decryption of data. So today I will show how to encrypt and decrypt data in our application. For this demo I used WPF application. Doing encryption and decryption is easy but we have to remember/know few things.

This example shows how you can use C# to encrypt and decrypt strings using a salt key to protect the data.

This type of encryption is called symmetric-key encryption that means the string can only be decrypted if the other party has the correct key (which is used for encryption).

So here is the code for encryption and decryption
